Allow me to introduce 'VioletEye' \u2014 the solution to your problems! My lab has developed and launched an orbital missile platform that can strike any target on the planet with conventional, high-yield explosives. But wait \u2014 there's more! The missiles travel at such a high speed that they're difficult to intercept without specialized equipment. The VioletEye satellite is only a prototype, but this seems like the perfect opportunity to test it, don't you think? Just be aware that if we use this weapon, it will take months to load it with new missiles.\"",
