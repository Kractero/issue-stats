Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he'll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. You're supposed to be our ally, but I get the feeling that you don't care about our people; you're just taking advantage of our location in case you need to launch missiles at the United Federation. Well, without your assistance, we'll soon have to ask for help from the Federation — which means they will force us to adopt 'free markets' and sell off all of our limited resources at rock-bottom prices. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford.\"",
