The whole operation here is being run by a rather boorish fellow by the name of General Stuppa. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Stuppa was constantly arguing with Colonel Sinwat, his second in command. General Stuppa kept shouting that @@NAME@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of attack by our military, Colonel Sinwat wouldn't support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. General Stuppa accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Stuppa and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NAME@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads.\" Bont's closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.",

Is that you?\" The static-obscured voice of James Bont is barely audible, causing Rimera to frantically increase the volume. \"I was able to infiltrate the enemy's bases by posing as a technician... at least until they caught me. Thankfully, I was able to swipe a guard's phone. The whole operation here is being run by a rather boorish fellow by the name of General Stuppa. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Stuppa was constantly arguing with Colonel Sinwat, his second in command. General Stuppa kept shouting that @@NAME@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of attack by our military, Colonel Sinwat wouldn't support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. General Stuppa accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Stuppa and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NAME@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads before they caught me.\" Bont's closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.",
